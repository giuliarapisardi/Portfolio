# Giulia Rapisardi's Portfolio

Here you can find various projects that I have worked on in the different courses I have completed at 
The University of Rhode Island. These projects involve different types of analysis using different data analysis
tools. Each project will have details on what is being performed, including the data sets and the final analysis.
