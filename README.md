# Giulia Rapisardi's Portfolio

Here you can find various projects that I have worked on in the different courses I have completed at 
The University of Rhode Island. These projects involve different types of analysis using different data analysis
tools. Each project will have details on what is being performed, including the data sets and the final analysis. 


##### Programming for Data Science

###### [Project 1](https://github.com/giuliarapisardi/Portfolio/blob/master/Notebooks/CSC%20310/Lab%202%20-%20Data%20Set%20Analysis%20(1).ipynb)
- This project demonstrates a basic analysis of the given data set that provides information on different details of different car models. 

###### [Project 2](https://github.com/giuliarapisardi/Portfolio/blob/master/Notebooks/CSC%20310/Lab%203%20-%20Decision%20Trees%20(1).ipynb)
- Decisions trees help us to understand the data set from labeled observations. It presents the learned information in the form of a tree so that we can clearly identify trends and conclusions in the data set without running analysis over and over again. This project demonstrates basic usage of decision trees and manipulating these tree models to identify the best fit tree for the easiest understanding of the data. 

###### [Project 3](https://github.com/giuliarapisardi/Portfolio/blob/master/Notebooks/CSC%20310/Lab%204%20-%20Visualizations%20(1).ipynb)
- Visualizations are a universal way of understanding data and trends in data. This project focuses on creating visualizing the data set to show different distributions throughout the data and to better help understand the data.
