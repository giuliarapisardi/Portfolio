# Giulia Rapisardi's Portfolio

A little about me ... 

I currently serve as a Business Analyst specializing in data-driven decision-making to improve operational efficiency and strategic planning. On a daily basis, I leverage advanced analytical tools to uncover insights that support growth initiatives and optimize healthcare delivery. Passionate about innovation and performance improvement, I play a key role in aligning data strategy with organizational goals.




Here you can find various projects that I have worked on in the different courses I have completed at The University of Rhode Island and Boston University. These projects involve other types of analysis using various data analysis tools and programs. Each project will include details on the tasks being performed, including the data sets and the final analysis. 



### Foundations of Analytics with R

##### [Final Analysis with R](https://github.com/giuliarapisardi/Portfolio/blob/master/Final_CS544_Rapisardi.md)
- This project is based on a dataset providing details on the Top 50 Songs on Spotify from the Year 2019. The project involves a semester's worth of R analysis skills that aid in answering the objective of whether or not there are common aspects of hit songs that make them popular. Analysis skills were used to find whether certain artists or genres were more successful than others.

### Programming for Data Science

###### [Project 1](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/giuliarapisardi/Portfolio/blob/master/Notebooks/CSC%20310/Lab%202%20-%20Data%20Set%20Analysis%20%281%29.ipynb)
- This project demonstrates a basic analysis of the given dataset that provides information on different details of different car models. 

###### [Project 2](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/giuliarapisardi/Portfolio/blob/master/Notebooks/CSC%20310/Lab%203%20-%20Decision%20Trees%20%281%29.ipynb)
- Decision trees help us to understand the dataset from labeled observations. It presents the learned information in the form of a tree to clearly identify trends and conclusions in the dataset without repeatedly running analyses. This project demonstrates basic usage of decision trees and manipulating these tree models to identify the best-fit tree for the most favorable understanding of the data. 

###### [Project 3](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/giuliarapisardi/Portfolio/blob/master/Notebooks/CSC%20310/Lab%204%20-%20Visualizations%20%281%29.ipynb)
- Visualizations are a universal way of understanding data and trends in data. This project focuses on creating a visualization of the dataset to show different distributions throughout the data and to better help understand the data.


### Introduction to Computer Programming

###### Project Overview
- This project was developed over the course of a semester from a dataset that provided information on thousands of YouTube channels. After reviewing the data, I wondered, Is there a relationship between the number of videos uploaded and the quality of the YouTube Channel? Throughout these projects, I aim to gain more information through analysis to answer this question. 


###### [Project 1](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/giuliarapisardi/Portfolio/blob/master/Notebooks/CSC%20201/Rapisardi_survey.ipynb)
- I created a survey program so that participants could immediately answer my survey questions for my data-driven question.  From this, I will be able to get a more immediate response to my survey questions, and participants will be able to give whatever response they like. The questions are general, asking about usage and what would make someone increase or decrease their YouTube usage. 

###### [Project 2](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/giuliarapisardi/Portfolio/blob/master/Notebooks/CSC%20201/Rapisardi_survey-Conditionals.ipynb)
- The survey has been edited so that there is a lack of invalid responses. For instance, if you are given a number scale from 1-10, you cannot enter 11 as a response. If the user does enter 11, they will no longer be able to take the survey, and the survey will end itself.  This is so that all responses are accurate and there is less of a need for data cleaning.  The conditional statements added to the survey allow us to get the best and most accurate responses. 

###### [Project 3](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/giuliarapisardi/Portfolio/blob/master/Notebooks/CSC%20201/Rapisardi_survey-Final.ipynb)
- This program is similar to the survey program, but functions and loops were added to the program. The same questions are asked, but the format of the output is now in a CSV format, and the survey can be taken over and over again until the user decides that they do not want to.

###### [Project 4](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/giuliarapisardi/Portfolio/blob/master/Notebooks/CSC%20201/Rapisardi_YouTube.ipynb)
- This program allows the usage of pandas to easily retrieve data from the YouTube data set that has all channels with corresponding ranks and grades by user input. The user is given a choice of either entering a rank, grade, or quitting the program. If they choose option 1, rank, they can enter any integer from 1 - 5000. If they choose option 2, they can choose any grade varying from A++, A+, A, A-, B+, or B. If they choose option 3, to quit the program, the program stops, and they will not be asked to choose an option again. 

###### [Project 5](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/giuliarapisardi/Portfolio/blob/master/Notebooks/CSC%20201/rapisardi_youtube_process.ipynb)
- This program extends the analysis of the YouTube data and cleans it so that appropriate graphs and pivot tables can be created. The cells that had no data or were missing data were removed from the data set so that all statistics were accurate. Several pivot tables support my data-driven question that the quality of a channel influences the popularity and number of subscribers to a channel.
